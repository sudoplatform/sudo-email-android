Your new password is XXXXXX.  Your old password will still work until
this password is used.  Go to the URL below to log in:

<https://toys.org/index.pl?op=userlogin&upasswd=XXXXXX&unickname=Frank4135&returnto=%2Flogin.pl%3Fop=changeprefs>

Make sure you then CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD!

If you have received this message without having requested it, it is
because someone attempted to use your username or e-mail address.  It
was mostly likely an innocent mistake, and they are not getting your
password, so you can safely disregard this message.

Thanks.

In case you get multiple emails you didn't request, the requester's IP
was 120.29.52.153.  Its user agent was
"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:55.0) Gecko"
(not that you should trust that value, but it might be interesting).
In case that's a properly-configured proxy,
the value of its X-Forwarded-For header was "120.29.52.153, 120.2" --
but don't trust that value unless you know a reason to (we don't).

If you don't use this new password within 3 days, it will expire
and you'll have to send yourself another one.
